## 🔧 Main Features

- **`bday`** – search for birthdays by name
	- If no search query is entered, all birthdays are shown.
 	- **The output format is: Name, Days until next birthday, Age on next birthday.**
	- Press `Shift + Enter` on an entry to delete it.
- **`add bday John Doe,9/3/2003`** – add a new person
- **`edit bday`** – open `birthdays.csv` in text editor for bulk editing
- **`build bday`** – builds the workflow from source (optional, as the signed and notarized binary is already provided)

## 📂 File format

Birthdays are stored in a file named `birthdays.csv`, located in the workflow's directory. Name and date are **comma-separated**. The date format is flexible – it supports different separators: `/`, `-`, or `.`. Each line must follow one of this formats:

```csv
name,date
John Doe,9/3/2003
John Doe,9-3-1990
John Doe,9.3.1990
```
